## Description:

The project Idea is to develop a cybercrime awareness and reporting application (CyberHush) that motivates users to educate themselves about cyber threats, seek assistance, and report incidents with any fear. 

## Key Features:

* The app will provide information on various types of cybercrimes,like  online harassment, phishing,  and more. 
* Users can report cybercrime incidents they have experienced or witnessed through the app.
* The application will implement authentication mechanisms, including both traditional username and password authentication and third-party authentication options like Google sign-in. 
* The application will add an online community where users can share their experiences, seek advice, and connect with others who have faced similar challenges.

## Daily Tasks:

* Initialize a Git repository and set up the project. 
* Created a low-fid design for the basic UI idea.
* Design a high-fid wireframe for the final UI look.
* Creating a basic backend server for the project.
* Add **GET** endpoints to retrieve or fetch the data.
* Add **Post** endpoints so that user can report a crime.
* Add **Put** endpoints for updating the status that the crime is resolved or not.
* Deploy the Backend server and initialize a basic frontend application.
